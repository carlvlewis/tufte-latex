\chapter*{Introduction}

This sample book discusses the design of Edward Tufte's
books\cite{Tufte2001,Tufte1990,Tufte1997,Tufte2006}
and the use of the \doccls{tufte-book} and \doccls{tufte-handout} document classes.

\chapter{A Main Heading}                % Print a "chapter" heading
Most of this example applies to \texttt{article} and \texttt{book} classes
as well as to \texttt{report} class. In \texttt{article} class, however,
the default position for the title information is at the top of
the first text page rather than on a separate page. Also, it is
not usual to request a table of contents with \texttt{article} class.
 
\section{A Subheading}                  % Print a "section" heading
The following sectioning commands are available:
\begin{quote}                           % The following text will be
 part \\                                %    set off and indented.
 chapter \\                             % \\ forces a new line
 section \\ 
 subsection \\ 
 subsubsection \\ 
 paragraph \\ 
 subparagraph 
\end{quote}                             % End of indented text
But note that---unlike the \texttt{book} and \texttt{report} classes---the
\texttt{article} class does not have a ``chapter" command.

\chapter{Another heading}
In August of 2011, the United Kingdom experienced a wave of riots that swept across the country. The first of these took place in the Tottenham neighborhood of London, where local resident Mark Duggan had recently been shot and killed by police. Within hours, riots had erupted in cities around the United Kingdom, from Manchester to Bristol, in neighborhoods and communities with no obvious connection to the events that took place in Tottenham. Violence, vandalism, and understandable panic gripped the nation. In the midst of these events, the \textit{Guardian}--led by Simon Rogers, founder and current editor of the Datablog--engaged in what might best be described as a real-time investigative-reporting effort to cover not only the where, when, and what of these riots, but also their why and how. Using social media reports, as well as court records, extensive data analysis, and on-the-ground reporting, the \textit{Guardian} eventually built the story of how these riots occurred and spread: largely through coordination efforts facilitated by digital communications. Though the \textit{Guardian}'s analysis would eventually reveal--counter to the claims of Prime Minister David Cameron--that Twitter and Facebook had played no role in spreading the mayhem, the rioters had made extensive use of BlackBerry Instant Messenger service to coordinate their activities\cite{Tufte2006}.
